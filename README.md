# System-design-and-analysis

Worked on a project for a client named DriverPass, in which we werre to design and create a application where they would be able to have users study and learn about local driving laws and requiments. The users would have access to stud material updated by the DMV and have the ability to sign up for driving tests to learn, practice and ultimatly pass the driving course provided by the DMV. 

If I was to revisit one of the project parts, it woul dbe the buisness requirments, I would go back and think more about the ideas and structure of the system and find new ways to interact with the user that would make the application easier to use and have more interaction with the user. 

I find that looking at the user requirments and the clients wishes I was able to implement everything they wanted in a thoughtout manner. 

Approaching design for the software i wanted to be in the shoes of the user and the admin that will need to perform maintenance on the system, I want the system to be user friendly and be able to be used for a long time with no issues.
