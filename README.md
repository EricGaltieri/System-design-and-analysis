# System-design-and-analysis

Worked on a project for a client named DriverPass, in which we werre to design and create a application where they would be able to have users study and learn about local driving laws and requiments. The users would have access to stud material updated by the DMV and have the ability to sign up for driving tests to learn, practice and ultimatly pass the driving course provided by the DMV. 

If I was to revisit one of the project parts, it woul dbe the buisness requirments, I would go back and think more about the ideas and structure of the system and find new ways to interact with the user that would make the application easier to use and have more interaction with the user.
